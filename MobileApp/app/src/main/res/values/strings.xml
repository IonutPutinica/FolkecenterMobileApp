    <string name="test_field_text_tour">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industrys standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</string>

    <string name="biodome_text_tour">The Biodome has 3 floors. The inner diameter of the floor plan is 14.4 meters and the largest inner diameter (floor plan at 1st floor) is 15.5 meters. The building is constructed with a skeleton of aluminum pipes, which are covered with 3-layer polycarbonate sheets. The building is manufactured in Colorado, USA and was established in 1992.
The floor plan is equipped with plant beds and with two 23 m3 water pools. The pools are the key of the system: the Azolla plants floating on the surface purify the rain water and act as food for fishes. The fishes than produce manure, which enriches the water. Finally, the water is used to irrigate the plants, making the whole process free of chemical fertilizers.
The 1st floor is furnished with plant beds with 50m2 cultivated soils. An automatic time-controlled irrigation system is also present.
Without the addition of heat other than solar energy, there is a Mediterranean climate in the Biodome, all year round. During summer, the top floor can reach even higher temperatures, allowing to grow plants typical of warmer climates.
 The Biodome is a so-called minimal construction with a light-bearing skeleton. Plant cultivation is possible for up to 10 months a year. In the coldest winter days there may be light frost at night, but the pools will not freeze.
The Biodome demonstrates how to integrate water circuits, recycling nutrient salts and soil and aquaculture.

    <string name="plus_house_text_tour">With a floor area of 600 m2, the building was constructed in 1992 by Folkecenter with support of the EU and the Danish Energy Agency. The Plus Energy House is a test house that produces more energy than it uses itself; it is composed of many different individual components, each of which has proven their efficiency.The house has a shape of a large solar collector: the south-facing facade consists of two layers of glass with 20cm between each layer; polystyrene balls stored in the silos behind the building can be injected in the façade, allowing to have insulation only when needed (for example, during the night), but also allowing to provide shade to the whole building, or part of it and, in this way, to control indoor climate. The house is also equipped with a heat pump.There are different temperature levels at the different floors: during a sunny summer day, the top floor can reach over 50°C. It has been documented through measuring that the house can deliver more heat to the district heating system of Folkecenter than it is supplied in the form of electricity to the heat pump, reason for which the house is called Plus Energy House.</string>

    <string name="plant_oil_lab_audio_tour">Plant Oil Lab Audio Tour</string>
    <string name="plant_oil_lab_text_tour">Since 1994, the Folkecenter has been working on plant oil for transport. There are several types of plant oil, depending on the seeds used. To be as sustainable as possible, seeds should come from locally-grown plants, so using avocado seeds in Denmark would not be a good idea. The best crop for this application in Denmark is rapeseed, which is grown mostly for feeding animals.
Out of 3 kg of rapeseed, 2 kg are of protein-rich seed cake (used for animals) and 1 kg is oil, which is equivalent to approximately 1.1 liters. The oil yield is therefore limited and it often raises questions concerning the sustainability of PPO and biofuels in general. However, something not often considered is that the leftovers of the plant become straw, which in Denmark is used for heat and power production. The energy output per hectare is, therefore, much higher than the one related to oil production alone.
Nevertheless, PPO is not the solution for all transportation: pipe emissions are approximately the same than those from conventional Diesel vehicles, so the only saving is in terms of processes: PPO does not need to be extracted, refined or transport from other parts of the world, making it more environmentally friendly. To be sustainable it has, however, to be kept local, maybe for those applications for which electric engines are still not suitable (for example, in tractors).
Concerning costs, German examples show that pressing accounts for approx. 1 DKK per kilo of oil, including investment, wages and process energy. The process energy is approx. 100-150 kWh / ton of oil, which corresponds to the energy content of 10-15 liters of oil.
Rape seed costs approx. 2 DKK per kilo, and the seed cakes value is approx. 1.2 DKK per kilo.
This means that the raw material price will be approx. DKK 3.45 per liter, which, in addition to the cost of pressing, gives a total production price of approx. DKK 4.45 per liter.
 In addition, VAT and taxes, distribution and profits should be added, making PPO comparable and, in some cases, slightly more expensive than Diesel.
The oil press can produce 2-4 liters of rapeseed oil per hour, depending on the quality of the rapeseed. In addition to oil, the press also produces seed cakes, which can be used to feed animals, due to their high protein content.

    <string name="floating_foundation_text_tour">The model is entirely the result of the work of Folkecenter trainees, from the design to the actual construction and testing. The model represents in scale the solutions which are now being considered in the industry of offshore wind turbines, to overcome the challenges posed by deep seawaters. The whole process was carried out between 2019 and 2020 by different groups of trainees and the concept has been tested in the local fjord. The floating foundation is now being connected to a small wind turbine which powers an LED installation. Blades, tower, foundation and LED illumination have all been developed and constructed by the trainees.</string>

    <string name="tip_no1_text">Energy efficient lightbulbs are a simple way to reduce the amount of power you use. Not only will this help the planet, it will also save your bank balance too. By replacing just one lightbulb, the effect can be tremendous. If every house in Europe did this, it would reduce pollution by the same amount as removing two million cars from the road!</string>

    <string name="tip_no2_text">Unless it’s absolutely essential, for example if you’re making bread, you don’t need to pre-heat the oven. You can just set it away when you are ready to start cooking. Bonus tip: When checking the food, look through the door rather than opening it until the final check.</string>
    <string name="tip_no3_text">You don’t have to give up meat for life, but try to commit to one meat free day a week. It takes 18,000 liters of water to produce a single kilogram of beef. And each hamburger that comes from animals on ex-forestry ground is responsible for the destruction of fifty-five square feet of forest.</string>
    <string name="tip_no4_text">If your car has a cruise control, then do use it! You paid for it along with the car anyway. This will help to improve your mileage at least by 15%, which will in the process save the environment, gasoline and your wallet.</string>
    <string name="tip_no5_text">A lot of things can be sourced second hand. Things that have a short usage period due to growth, for example, a child’s bicycle, can be picked up second hand in fantastic condition and also at a fraction of the price. This saves you money and helps to reduce packaging materials.</string>
    <string name="tip_no6_text">Make sure to recycle your old newspapers - 69% (or 44 million newspapers) of the newspapers printed in the USA are thrown away every day. Even if you recycle only once per week, half a million trees could be saved. Or even better, why not avoid newspapers altogether and read the online versions!</string>
    <string name="tip_no7_text">Switching your bath for a shower can make a huge difference. Baths use approximately double the amount of water a shower uses. This not only saves water, but it saves you money on heating the excess water too.</string>
    <string name="tip_no8_text">Adjusting the temperature in your home by just one degree can save you 10% on your energy use over the year. This is another great saving you and another great help for the planet. Where possible, set a timer so your heating/cooling doesn’t need to be on when you aren’t home.</string>
    <string name="tip_no9_text">Plastic carrier bags are not biodegradable, nor are they recyclable. They sit in landfills where they often end up polluting the ocean and infiltrating food sources. Use a stronger, reusable bag.</string>
    <string name="tip_no10_text">Bottled water is handy when you’re on the go, but why not buy one bottle and then refill it from the tap or your work’s water cooler. Around 90% of water bottles end up decomposing in landfills rather than being recycled.</string>
